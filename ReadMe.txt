Assumptions

 From the instructions, it wasnt clear whether the application is meant to be interactive
 hence I have not created an interactive interface as I assumed that it was not interactive.

 However, the tests simulate the behaviour of an explorer navigating the maze. The ExplorerEngineTests
 fully traverses the given maze until the finish location is reached and simulates a fully working
 application.

 The ReporterTests shows the two different kinds of reports that are supported (i.e visual and coordinate reports)

 All the other tests, test all the individual components that are required for a fully working
 working explorer application

 All the acceptance criteria have been met by the components and can be verified by the tests

 If interactivity is required, please let me know and I can provide one because to  make the app interactive
 simply requires passing instructions to the GuidanceSystem.
